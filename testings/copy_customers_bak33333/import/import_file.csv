"Red Rum Soothing Rinse","RED RUM Soothing Rinse is one our MUST HAVE products.

Containing Witch Hazel and Arnica, this is the ideal way to cool a tired horse after exercise, soothe tired limbs and reduce swelling. It also also removes sweat, dirt and deodorizes the coat leaving a fresh cucumber fragrance.  Simply add 30ml to a bucket of water and sponge over the horse or pony and either leave to dry or squeegie off with a sweat scraper. With the added benefit of being NO-RINSE.

"NAF Himalayan Salt Lick","Most mass-produced salt licks consist of salt with artificially added minerals and trace elements. These minerals, such as potassium and magnesium, and the trace elements, are important for your horse’s health, however in commercial salt production they are regarded as impurities and are removed during the production process. The other thing with most 'commercial' licks is that they may contain a high percentage of fillers and binders and lord knows what else to make them the colour, shape, texture, smell that they are. Himalayan salt licks are mined from natural salt deposits that are over 550 million years old. They are rich in minerals and trace elements which give the salt licks their distinctive pink colour. Each lick comes ready with a handy rope to allow it to be hung on a gate or fence. They are extremely hard, making them very weather resistant and more difficult for the horse to bite chunks off, which is what often happens with the softer, pressed, salt licks. Experience with these salt licks has shown that horses do prefer them. Whilst NAF quote 750 grams as the weight of this item, the actual weight is usually more than this. Actual weight may vary slightly from lick to lick, due to the natural nature of this product.
