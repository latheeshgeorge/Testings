<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: small;">This narrow stiff-bristled nylon brush is just the tool you need for cleaning the inside of the milk frothing wand on your espresso machine. Even if you are very careful about wiping the milk frothing wand there is usually a little milk that ends up being drawn back up the pipe. On most espresso machines you can remove the tip from the end of the milk frothing wand and use this brush to eliminate any residues from the pipe keeping it clean and hygienic.</span></p>
