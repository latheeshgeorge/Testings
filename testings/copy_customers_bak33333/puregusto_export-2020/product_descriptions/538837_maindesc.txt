<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva;"><em><strong>What does it taste like?</strong></em></span><br /><span style="font-size: small; font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva;">A hearty and well-rounded cup of tea. Like your normal cup of tea, but better. The kind that reminds you why you love tea.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small; font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva;"><em><strong>Where does it come from?</strong></em></span><br /><span style="font-size: small; font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva;">The very first cup of tea was made in Yunnan in China over 2000 years ago. It must have been good, because we're still sourcing leaves from there today. We love their toasty flavours. We blend them with other leaves from around the world like Assam for body and African for a bit of punch. With over 300 years of blending know-how, we know we've made this cup the best it can be.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small; font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva;"><em><strong>What makes this tea different?</strong></em></span><br /><span style="font-size: small; font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva;">We use leaves from our favourite tea-growing regions&nbsp;including Assam and Africa. Then we add the best Yunnan, for it's unique toasty flavour.</span></p>
