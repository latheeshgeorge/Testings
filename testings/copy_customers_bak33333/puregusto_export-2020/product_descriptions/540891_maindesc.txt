<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva;" data-mce-mark="1">A&nbsp;national caramel wafer test of a large Dutch newspaper (Algemeen Dagblad, the 18th of November 2004), our caramel wafers were rated the best caramel wafers of the Netherlands! Our giant all-butter wafers were rewarded with no less than 10 points (on a scale from 1 to 10) and the panel noted that our product exceeded the rest by far. And we must say we&rsquo;re fairly proud of this result.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva;" data-mce-mark="1">So much so that these delicious wafers are used by some of the largest chains in the world, including starbucks costa and caffe nero starbucks and costa each grossing over &pound;1m turnover on this line alone per annum.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva;">Each 9cm Jumbo caramel waffle is individually wrapped and ready to sell with costings from under 30p and an rsp of over 65p there's healthy margins to be had on this impulse purchase with the two big chains commanding a profit whopping &pound;1 - &pound;1.50 price per waffle.</span></p>
