<h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;">Jura Air Intake Nozzle</span></h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;">We recommend a replacement period of 1-2 months on this, and also find customers seem to lose this piece quite ofter whilst cleaning this part of the machine. It is easy to replace and comes in a single nozzle so no need to buy a few of them you can just replace when you need too.</span></p>
