<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;">Plump cranberries and velvety raspberries shine softly in the evening sunlight. This blend brings you the best of both delicious fruits: the tart sweetness of cranberries, balanced with the gentle tang of raspberries ? and a touch of fragrant elderflower. The result is a delightfully lively infusion, bursting with the taste of summer. Made with all-natural ingredients ? nothing more, nothing less. Naturally caffeine free with no added sugar, enjoy any time of the day. Fancy yours chilled? Allow the infusion to cool before adding some ice and a few fresh raspberries.</span></p>
