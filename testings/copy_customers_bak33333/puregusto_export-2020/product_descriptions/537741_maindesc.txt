<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva;" data-mce-mark="1">No one wants to drink a room temperature cup of coffee, and foam acts as an insulator and keeps coffee warm for a long time. Plus, foam cups do not get hot like other kinds of disposables, and this makes them easier on the hands. Foam cups can be recycled into insulation and many other fine products, and Dart Corporation is proud to be environmentally conscious. They are the recipient of the 2013 EPS Industry Alliance Excellence in EPS Recycling Award.</span></p>
