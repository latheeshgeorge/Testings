<p><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: small;">The Lavazza Gold Selection Coffee Beans come from a blend made from selected plantations in Brazil, Central America and Asia. The blend is put together to give you a mellow and sweet tasting coffee with an intense aftertaste. This also is a medium roasting coffee and will also give you a noticeable chocolatey aftertaste.</span></p>
