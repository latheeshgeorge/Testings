<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: small;">Redbush (or Rooibos in Afrikaans) is made using the freshest leaves of the Redbush plant. The beating hot sun in the Western Cape province of South Africa gives the tea its juicy, refreshing flavour and copper-red colour.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: small;">Because it's full of anti-oxidants and naturally caffeine-free, you can drink Redbush day or night. Just shut your eyes and savour each sip of sunshine</span></p>
