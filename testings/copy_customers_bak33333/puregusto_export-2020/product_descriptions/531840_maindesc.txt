<h1 style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</h1>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;">We offer here a range of different milk foaming jugs all finished with a stainless steel design. Our straight sided milk foam jugs are perfect for frothing milk for cappuccinos and lattes. We also offer a belly shaped jug which seems to be a favourite, as this is excellent for frothing milks and customers find it easier to froth, pour and handle using this one. Both of these jugs come in a range of sizes (select the drop down box) to accomodate for exacly what you need.</span></p>
