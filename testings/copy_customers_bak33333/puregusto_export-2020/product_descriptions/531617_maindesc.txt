<h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva;">&nbsp;</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: small;">The story goes that Earl Grey, the Georgian prime minister, was given cases of this tea by a Chinese Mandarin. He liked it so much he brought it home and asked Twinings to recreate it for him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: small;">Light, fragrant and with a distinctive bergamot and lemon flavour, our Earl Grey still has all the taste of the original, and we like to think it's still the best.</span></p>
