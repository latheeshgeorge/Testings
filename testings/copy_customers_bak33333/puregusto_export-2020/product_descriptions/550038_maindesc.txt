<p><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: small;">Limescale in your coffee or espresso machine will reduce the quality of the coffee and the durability of the machine. Why? Limescale build-up prolongs the time it takes to make the coffee, causing reduced heat transfer which results in a coffee of lower quality. The limescale build-up will keep thickening until it becomes a blockage. Limescale will lead to corrosion of the materials in the machine, resulting in damage. Limescale also leads to an increased energy consumption.</span></p>
