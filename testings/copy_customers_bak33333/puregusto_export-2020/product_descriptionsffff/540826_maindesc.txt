<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva;" data-mce-mark="1">The Chicopee Coffee Towel is the first cleaning cloth specifically designed for coffee machines. Our customers told us about their need for a cleaner cup of coffee. Especially when it comes to the bacteria-sensitive steam pipe, which comes in direct contact with the milk that will go into a customer&rsquo;s cup. Preventing cross-contamination is essential. Effective cleaning is the key.</span></p>
<p><br /><span style="font-size: small; font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva;" data-mce-mark="1">The Coffee Towel prevents the spread of bacteria and makes coffee machine cleaning easy. Its special, thicker material is heat resistant up to 250&deg;C to prevent burns. Its Food Contamination Clearing certification ensures ultimate hygiene. Its open weave structure means easier clean-up and better rinsing.</span></p>
