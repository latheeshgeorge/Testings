<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva;"><strong>COFFEE VACUUM CAN</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva;"><em><strong>Keep your coffee fresher longer</strong></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva;">The moment coffee comes out of the pack or indeed the moment its roasted it begins to deteriorate, the intense aromas and flavours begin to break down and taste can be lost within days if exposed to air.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva;">In light of this, we highly recommend our espresso gear vacuum cans - these ingenious items can store 500g of unused coffee, ideal if you have just topped your bean hopper up or indeed you purchase pre-ground decaf and want to keep it fresher for longer....</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fear <span style="font-size: small; font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva;">not the vacuum can will keep both beans and ground coffee fresh at the touch of a button. The unique push-button&nbsp;lid enables harmful air to leave the can preserving the coffee inside.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva;">No coffee serving establishment or indeed any coffee lover that cares about the quality of its product should be without one of these...</span></p>
