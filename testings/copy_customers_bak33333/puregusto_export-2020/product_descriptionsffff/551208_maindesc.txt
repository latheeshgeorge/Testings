<p><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: small;">It all started in 1933 when the enterprising Francesco Illy founded Illycaff&egrave; in his family's home in Trieste, Italy. He devised a new packaging system for preserving coffee in which the cans were filled with inert gases - most other systems try to remove the air but some is always left. Thanks to this new packaging system, Illy coffee soon spread outside the immediate Trieste area and eventually reached all over the world.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: small;">Every day 5 million cups of this single exclusive blend of 100% Arabica coffee beans are enjoyed around the world!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: small;">Each pod is individually foil wrapped to maintain freshness and the outer box serves as a dispenser for each serving.</span></p>
