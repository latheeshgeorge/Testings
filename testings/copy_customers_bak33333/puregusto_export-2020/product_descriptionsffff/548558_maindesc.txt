<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva;">Birchall English Breakfast Tea is a unique, masterful blend, closely guarded by the fifth generation of Birchall Graham&rsquo;s family. Our teas are sourced entirely from estates across East Africa, from Rwanda through to the Rift Valley in Kenya, where the very best teas are to be found.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva;">This is how Birchall English Breakfast Tea gains its exceptional brightness, golden colour and strong refreshing flavour.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva;">Our English Breakfast tea can be enjoyed anytime but we particularly enjoy it mid morning when you fancy carving out a small but precious moment for yourself in between your busy schedule.</span></p>
