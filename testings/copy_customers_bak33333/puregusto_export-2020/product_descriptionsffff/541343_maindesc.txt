<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-size: small; font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva;"><em>Outstandingly Pure Water</em></span></strong></p>

<h1 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva;">Quality Controlled by Mother Nature</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva;">Icelandic Glacial&trade; natural spring water is the result of a perfect combination of environmental characteristics that create a remarkably fresh, balanced water with a clean finish.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva;"><strong>Naturally Low Mineral Levels for a Fresh, Clean Taste</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva;">The Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) level reflects the amount of sodium, calcium, magnesium and other minerals in the water. These affect the taste, balance and character of the water. Icelandic Glacial has one of the lowest TDS levels amongst other premium water brands.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva;"><strong>High Alkalinity and Healthy pH Balance</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva;">Icelandic Glacial also features a highly desirable, uncommonly elevated and naturally occurring alkaline pH level of 8.4.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva;"><strong>Keeping the Water Untouched Helps Keep it Pure</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva;">The water we collect flows directly into our state-of-the-art bottling plant located right at the source, in Hlidarendi, Iceland at the edge of the &Ouml;lfus Spring. Nothing is added or taken away, and the water is never exposed to outside air.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: small; font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva;">Naturally Protected. Continually Renewed.</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva;"><span class="moz_up">I</span>n order to help preserve the beautiful majestic landscape of Iceland, Icelandic Glacial&trade; is sourced from the naturally replenishing underground &Ouml;lfus&nbsp;Spring.</span></p>
<p><br /><span style="font-size: small; font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva;">The legendary &Ouml;lfus&nbsp;Spring was forged during a massive volcanic&nbsp;eruption over 5,000 years ago. Shielded by an impenetrable layer of lava rock and surrounded by a 128,000 acre exclusion zone, the Spring is constantly replenished&nbsp;by a gradual filtration of rainfall and snowmelt over uninhabited and untouched lava fields.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva;"><strong>A Natural, Renewable Product<br /></strong>With over 900,000 cubic meters of water overflowing from the &Ouml;lfus&nbsp;Spring&nbsp;into the ocean&nbsp;every day, it's one of the world's largest natural springs. Indeed, the overflow alone is more than twice the amount of all bottled water consumed worldwide. Taking great care never to damage or deplete the Spring, Icelandic Glacial sources less than 0.1% of the total water that naturally flows to the surface.</span></p>
