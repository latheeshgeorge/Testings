<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;">Lavazza Tierra Arabica coffee beans are produced using 100% arabica coffee beans which are also Rainforest Alliance certified. The blends are made up of both Central and South America arabica beans, which helps portray the delicate acidic arome from the South American beans whilst also giving you the intense liquorice flavours from the Central American beans. The Lavazza Tierra Arabica coffee is a medium strength coffee that gives you a sweet, light and fluffy taste with a thick and mellow crema.</span></p>
