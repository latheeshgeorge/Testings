<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva;">To keep things that way, regular maintenance is essential. For complete hygiene, every JURA coffee machine features integrated rinsing and cleaning programmes. We recommend performing milk system cleaning once a day. With normal use, the milk pipe will then only have to be replaced after 3 months. The accessory set for milk systems is available to buy on our website...</span></p>
