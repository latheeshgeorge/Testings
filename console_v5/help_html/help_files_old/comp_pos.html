	<td class="main_header_subtext">Edit website layout section allows to manipulate the positions of various features in the site. The position can be set for featuresby dragging and droping them to required positions. The sections in website layout page may differ a bit with respect to the template used in the site. In order to get a better understanding of this section, the concept of templates and layout should be clear. Bshop4 is packed with a number of predefined templates which can be used for various sites. Templates decides the color theme for the site and also the layouts for the site. Layouts are the diffent types of arrangements. That is, the layout decides the way in which the features in the site will be displayed while viewing different  pages. One template can have more than one layout. In such a case different pages in the site will be displayed in a different arrangement to the customer. Using the Website layout edit section we are giving the console user the flexibility to arrange the features existing in the site in required positions in different layouts. </td>

  <td class="level1_header_subtext">In order to position a component at a particular location, drag and drop the component to the required position from the  &quot;Available Components&quot; section. When a component is dragged and dropped from the &quot;Available Component&quot; section to any of the positons, that component will be removed form the &quot;Available Component&quot; section and will only be visible in the position to which it has been dragged and droppped. Once the components are set to required positions, click on &quot;Save Positions&quot; to save the changes. When clicked on &quot;Save Positions&quot; button the page will get reloaded and the section &quot;Available Components&quot; will again show all the components, including the one's which have been dragged and dropped to various positions.
