  <td class="main_header_subtext">In order to track the clicks that are coming from such paid links placed in third party websites, first an entry should be added in the cost per click section in the console of your site. An entry can be created with details like Keyword to be advertised, where you are advertising, your website url where visitors to be landed when clicked from the sponsored links, cost per click which you have to pay for each click you are getting and the fraud click rule. Once the entry is created, the url to be placed as link in the third party site will be displayed in the edit page of that cost per click entry. Copy this URL and publish it in the thrid party website.<br /><br />	 
  
When a visitor clicks on your keyphrase from the thrid party website, she/he will be initially taken to this URL first and which in turn will take the visitor to the actual intended page(f.e product or category) in your website after tracking the IP address and checking the fraud click rule you have set. If the system recognize a  click as a fraud click that is repeatedly coming from the same IP address then an appropriate fraud detection message will be displayed to the visitor.</td>
