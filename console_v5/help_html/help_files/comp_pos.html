	<td class="main_header_subtext">Edit website layout section allows to manipulate the positions of various features in the website. Various features in the website are displayed graphically as rectangular boxes. The position can be set for the features by dragging and droping them to required positions. The sections in website layout page may differ a bit with respect to the template used in the site. In order to get a better understanding of this section, the concept of templates and layout should be clear. Bshop4 is packed with a number of predefined templates which can be used for various sites. Templates decides the color theme for the site and also the layouts for the site. Layouts are the diffent types of arrangements. That is, the layout decides the way in which the features in the site will be displayed while viewing different  pages. One template can have more than one layout. In such a case different pages in the site will be displayed in a different arrangement to the customer. Using the &quot;Edit Website layout  section&quot; we are giving the console user the flexibility to arrange the features existing in the site in required positions in different layouts. </td>
