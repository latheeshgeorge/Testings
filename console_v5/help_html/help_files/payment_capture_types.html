<tr>
  <td class="level2_header">1. Normal </td>

<tr>
  <td class="level2_header_subtext">This is the default method, funds will be transferred to your account at the time of transaction itself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="level2_header">2. Prea auth </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="level2_header_subtext">A PREAUTH requests an authorisation against the card. No funds are transferred to your account, nor can they ever be. It does, however, confirm that the card is valid and has available funds at the time of the PREAUTH. At a later date, for example when you are ready to ship goods, you send a REPEAT payment request using the Repeat button to charge the card with the full value of the transaction without the need for you to hold the customer&rsquo;s card details anywhere on your servers. PREAUTH is useful when there is a long delay between order and fulfilment, or if you are uncertain of the exact value of the transaction at the time of order </td>

  <td class="level2_header">3. Deferred </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="level2_header_subtext">If you know the exact value of the transaction at the time of order placement and you are able to settle that payment within 6 days of placing the order, Deferred Payment is the best system for you to use.</td>

<tr>
  <td class="level2_header">4.  Authenticate</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="level2_header_subtext">If you wish to delay the payment for longer than 6 days or if you do not know the exact price at the time the order is placed, Authenticate is the best option for you</td>
